            <h1>Human History Timeline</h1>

            <h2>World Peace</h2>
            <p>
                Humanity achieves the means to stop eons of constant warfare. The world population is freed to move unhindered across the planet's surface.
                Forbidden <a href="site/technology.html">technologies</a> are rediscovered.
                After a series of public accidents, restrictions on experimentation are agreed upon and placed on all <em>Nth Dimension Technology</em>.
                Humanity discovers the existence of other intelligent life including breakaway human civilizations and first contact becomes imminent.
            </p>

            <h2>Invasion</h2>
            <p>
                First Contact is shattered as an alien invasion commences and all major human cities are attacked. Human artifacts and monuments are destroyed worldwide. Mysterious mass evacuations begin to occur in some surface cities.
                World order is restored under the militarized pretense of resisting the alien invasion. All human civilization is once again reorganized as either for the war effort or against it.

            <p>
                The far side of <a href="site/locations.html">the Moon</a> is chosen for the final assault against the invaders and their supposed primary base...
            </p>

            <h2>Cataclysm</h2>
            <p>
                A sizable human SAS assault fleet is launched into orbit to eliminate the Alien Threat and re-occupy the Moon.
                As the fleet approaches, the Moonâ€™s surface suddenly sheers off into a massive debris field that falls towards the Earth, destroying the assault fleet, and plummeting into the Earth's surface.
            </p>

            <p>
                A small fire-team survives the debris field and successfully navigates to the Moon base. Upon arrival, they immediately discover the base to be long-abandoned, save for a single switch, The Reset Switch...
